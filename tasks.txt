Currently, the Left Column ("💰 Giá gốc") only shows summary statistics (Average, Range, Median, Count). It does not show how the system derived the $18.64 figure.Recommendation:You need to port the logic from generate_price_report (Step 1-4) into this Streamlit column. It should look something like this:💰 Giá gốc (Base Price):Step 1 - Volume: $69 \times 30 \times 10 \text{ cm} = \mathbf{0.0207 \text{ m}^3}$Step 2 - Conversion: Converted 5 reference prices to USD/m³.Step 3 - Weighted Avg: $\approx \$900.52 \text{ / m}^3$ (weighted by recency).Step 4 - Final: $\$900.52 \times 0.0207 = \mathbf{\$18.64}$(Then list the stats: Range, Median, etc.)2. 📉 Trend Presentation ("Xu hướng")Current: 📉 Xu hướng: -2.5%Observation: This is good, but it might be helpful to indicate what this trend represents. Is it year-over-year? Or the trend within the selected sample set?Suggestion: If this is based on the 2024 vs. 2025 data in your sample, you might label it: 📉 Trend (YoY): -2.5%.3. 📊 Confidence Score FormattingThe Right Column is very detailed, which is great. However, the format Score (Value) might be slightly confusing to a new user (e.g., "75 (5)" looks like "75 out of 5").Current: • Số mẫu: 75 (5)Suggestion: Use a clearer separator or label:• Số mẫu: Score 75 (Count: 5)Or simply: • Số mẫu: 5 samples (Score: 75) — Putting the actual value first is often more readable for humans.4. 📐 "Tiêu chí" (Priority Strictness)Current: • Tiêu chí: 56 (56%)Observation: "56%" is an abstract number for "Priority Strictness".Suggestion: You might want to map this back to text for the value part.Instead of 56 (56%), display: • Tiêu chí: 56 (Mixed Priorities) or • Tiêu chí: 56 (Priority 1 & 2).
